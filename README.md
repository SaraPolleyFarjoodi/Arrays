# Arrays
Program does the following:

- printing constants of a 1-D array.
- Adding to arrays, referencing one array to the other. for loops vs enhanced for loops.
- Assigning values from a 1-D array to a 2-D array. print contents of first row of 2-D array.
- Using ArrayLists to create arrays that don't require size to be initialized.

All functions are tested, and the output of that testing is displayed in testing.txt file.
